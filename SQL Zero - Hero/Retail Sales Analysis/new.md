## Retail Sales SQL Analysis

This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze and clean a retail sales dataset using PostgreSQL. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of each query along with its purpose.

### 🔧 Data Cleaning

**Q1. Fix column encoding issues:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE retail_sales
RENAME COLUMN "ï»¿transactions_id" TO transaction_id;
```

**Q2. View raw data:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales;
```

**Q3. Identify NULLs in key columns:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	"transaction_id" IS NULL OR
	"sale_date" IS NULL OR
	"sale_time" IS NULL OR
	"customer_id" IS NULL OR
	"gender" IS NULL OR
	"category" IS NULL OR
	"quantiy" IS NULL OR
	"price_per_unit" IS NULL OR
	"cogs" IS NULL OR
	"total_sale" IS NULL;
```

**Q4. Delete rows with NULLs:**

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	"transaction_id" IS NULL OR
	"sale_date" IS NULL OR
	"sale_time" IS NULL OR
	"customer_id" IS NULL OR
	"gender" IS NULL OR
	"category" IS NULL OR
	"quantiy" IS NULL OR
	"price_per_unit" IS NULL OR
	"cogs" IS NULL OR
	"total_sale" IS NULL;
```

### 📊 Data Exploration

**Q5. Total sales count:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
```

**Q6. Unique customers:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "customer_id") AS Total_Customer FROM retail_sales;
```

**Q7. Unique categories:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "category") AS Total_Category FROM retail_sales;
```

### 📈 Advanced Analysis

**Q8. Get all Clothing transactions where quantity > 10 in Nov 2022:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
	"category" = 'Clothing' AND
	"quantiy" > 10 AND
	TO_DATE("sale_date", 'DD-MM-YYYY')
	BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';
```

**Q9. Average sale per month:**

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY'), 'Month') AS sale_month,
  ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_monthly_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY'), 'Month'),
         EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY'))
ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY'));
```

**Q10. Best-selling month in each year:**

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY')) AS year,
    TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY'), 'Month') AS month_name,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(sale_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY')) AS month_num,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
  FROM retail_sales
  GROUP BY year, month_name, month_num
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (year)
  year, month_name, ROUND(total_sales, 2) AS total_sales
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY year, total_sales DESC;
```

**Q11. Add time of day (shift) label:**

```sql
SELECT 
  "sale_time",
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM "sale_time"::TIME) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM "sale_time"::TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS time_of_day
FROM retail_sales;
```

**Q12. Count number of orders by shift:**

```sql
SELECT time_of_day, COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders FROM (
  SELECT 
    sale_time,
    CASE 
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM "sale_time"::TIME) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM "sale_time"::TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
      ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS time_of_day
  FROM retail_sales
) AS shifts
GROUP BY time_of_day
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC;
```

### 📌 Key Findings

* The majority of orders occurred in the **Afternoon**, followed by **Evening**.
* **Clothing** category had high-value bulk orders, especially in **November 2022**.
* The **best-selling months** vary by year, suggesting seasonality in customer behavior.
* There are noticeable data quality issues (e.g., encoding errors, missing values) that were cleaned.

---

### 📊 Reports & Insights

* **Monthly Sales Trend**: Identified average sales for each month, useful for forecasting.
* **Shift-wise Sales Volume**: Helps allocate resources efficiently based on time-of-day performance.

### **1. Introduction**

This report presents the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Geldium's delinquency prediction dataset. The primary goal is to assess data quality, identify early risk indicators, and prepare the dataset for predictive modeling. Insights from this analysis will support Tata iQ's analytics team in refining intervention strategies.

### **2. Dataset Overview**

**Key dataset attributes:**

* Number of records: **500**

* Key variables:

  * `Customer_ID`: Unique identifier for each customer
  * `Income`, `Credit_Score`, `Credit_Utilization`: Financial metrics
  * `Missed_Payments`, `Delinquent_Account`: Behavioral and target features
  * `Employment_Status`, `Location`, `Account_Tenure`: Demographic and account details

* Data types:

  * **Numerical:** Age, Income, Credit\_Score, Credit\_Utilization, Loan\_Balance, etc.
  * **Categorical:** Employment\_Status, Location, Credit\_Card\_Type, Month\_1 to Month\_6

---

### **3. Missing Data Analysis**

**Key missing data findings:**

* Variables with missing values:

  * `Income` – 39 missing
  * `Credit_Score` – 2 missing
  * `Loan_Balance` – 29 missing

**Missing data treatment:**

* `Income`: Imputed using **median** due to skewness
* `Credit_Score`: Imputed using **mean** (minimal missing entries)
* `Loan_Balance`: To be imputed using **regression-based imputation** from related features

---

### **4. Key Findings and Risk Indicators**

**Key findings:**

* High **Credit Utilization** correlates with higher delinquency
* Customers with **multiple missed payments** across 6 months are more likely to be delinquent
* **Low Credit Score** and **short Account Tenure** also indicate increased risk

**Unexpected anomalies:**

* Some customers with many missed payments are marked as non-delinquent, suggesting potential labeling or behavioral inconsistencies

---

### **5. AI & GenAI Usage**

Generative AI tools were used to summarize the dataset, suggest data imputation strategies, and detect patterns.

**Example AI prompts used:**

* "Summarize key patterns, outliers, and missing values in this dataset. Highlight any fields that might present problems for modeling delinquency."
* "Suggest an imputation strategy for missing values in this dataset based on industry best practices."
* "Identify the top 3 variables most likely to predict delinquency based on this dataset. Provide brief reasoning."

### **6. Conclusion & Next Steps**

This EDA revealed critical missing data areas and strong predictors of delinquency such as credit utilization and missed payments.
**Next steps** include completing data imputation, performing feature engineering, and building a predictive model to support Geldium in prioritizing interventions for at-risk customers.

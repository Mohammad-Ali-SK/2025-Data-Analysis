## 🎤 **Data Storytelling Script: Uber Trip Analysis with SQL & Power BI**

---

### 🧑‍💼 1. Introduction: Setting the Context

Hello! I’m **Mohammad Ali**, and I’m excited to walk you through a real-world analytics project I completed — analyzing **over 103,000 Uber trips** using a combination of **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **data cleaning techniques**.

This project was designed to simulate a real business scenario:
**"How can a ride-hailing company optimize their operations and customer experience based on trip data?"**

---

### 🧽 2. Data Understanding & Cleaning

I started with a **raw dataset in CSV format** containing over 100,000+ Uber ride records. It included fields like:

* Pickup & drop-off locations and cities
* Trip distance & duration
* Vehicle types (UberX, Comfort, Black, Green, XL)
* Payment methods
* Fare and surge fee

I cleaned the data by:

* Removing duplicates and null values
* Standardizing location and city names
* Extracting hour from pickup time for time-based analysis
* Creating meaningful columns like **Total Revenue = Fare + Surge Fee**

---

### 🛠️ 3. SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis

Next, I ran detailed **SQL queries** to explore patterns and generate insights. Some key examples:

🔹 **Basic Analysis:**

* Counted total trips: `103,000+`
* Found peak hours: most rides between **2 PM and 6 PM**
* Identified that **UberX** had the highest usage
* Analyzed preferred payment method: **Uber Pay (67%)**

🔹 **Intermediate to Advanced Queries:**

* Ranked top pickup-drop-off pairs (e.g., *Penn Station → Upper East Side*)
* Calculated revenue by city
* Average surge by payment type
* Tracked trips from Manhattan to Queens
* Ranked payment methods and calculated **average fare/minute by vehicle**

SQL helped me structure the story before building visuals — giving me confidence about the data's meaning and business value.

### 📊 4. Dashboard Design in Power BI

Once the data was ready, I imported it into **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard split into **three key pages**:

---

#### 📍 A. Overview Dashboard

This section gives a high-level snapshot:

* **Total Bookings**: 103,044
* **Total Revenue**: \$1.54 million
* **Average Trip**: 3 miles, 16 mins, \$14.90
* **Most Used Vehicle**: UberX (38K+ trips)

🔹 **Top Pickup Point**: Penn Station / Madison Sq West
🔹 **Top Drop-off**: Upper East Side North
🔹 **Longest Ride**: 144 miles (Lower East Side → Crown Heights North)

Also added breakdowns by:

* **Payment Type**: Uber Pay, Cash, Amazon Pay
* **Trip Type**: Day (65%) vs. Night (35%)
* **Vehicle Usage**: UberX, Comfort, Green, Black, XL

---

#### ⏱️ B. Time Analysis Dashboard

Focused on trends by hour and day of the week:

* Ride volume surges **between 2 PM to 6 PM**
* **Sunday and Tuesday** are the busiest days
* Used **heatmap matrix** to show ride density by hour & day

This helped identify when and where demand peaks, which is critical for **fleet optimization and marketing campaigns**.

---

#### 📋 C. Detailed Trip Table

This page includes:

* Full trip-level data (filterable by vehicle, city, time)
* Useful for auditing or slicing by business unit
* Helps drill down into customer behavior

---

### 🔍 5. Key Insights & Findings

Here are some data-driven discoveries:

* **UberX** accounts for over **37%** of bookings
* **Afternoon rides** and **weekends** are in highest demand
* **Uber Pay** dominates with **67%** of payment share
* A few city zones like **Penn Station & Upper East Side** handle most traffic
* Only **a few vehicle types** generate the majority of revenue

---

### 💡 6. Strategic Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I proposed:

1. 📈 **Boost UberX fleet** in peak zones and times
2. 🌙 **Encourage night trips** with promo codes or discounts
3. 💳 **Push Uber Pay adoption** with loyalty points
4. 📍 **Improve driver allocation** near high-traffic locations
5. 🕐 **Launch campaigns** between 2 PM–6 PM on weekends

---

### ✅ 7. Conclusion

This project helped me sharpen key skills:

* **Data storytelling and insight generation**
* **DAX-based KPI building in Power BI**
* **SQL querying for data exploration**
* **Dashboard UX & business communication**

More importantly, it showed how data can support **real business decisions** in the transportation and mobility sector.

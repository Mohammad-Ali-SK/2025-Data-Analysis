🎥 YouTube Script – Uber Trip Analysis (Portfolio Project)
🎬 Intro (0:00–0:20)
"Hi everyone! I'm Mohammad Ali, and welcome to my Power BI portfolio project. Today, I’ll walk you through a real-world data analysis dashboard I built using Uber trip data. The goal was to uncover key business insights through interactive visuals, KPIs, and storytelling."

📊 Section 1: Project Overview (0:20–1:00)
"This dataset contains over 103,000 Uber ride records. I used Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize the data across three main areas: Overview, Time Analysis, and Detailed Trip Data. The project helps us understand customer behavior, trip patterns, vehicle performance, and payment preferences."

🟦 Section 2: Overview Dashboard (1:00–2:00)
"Let’s start with the overview page. Here, you’ll see key metrics:
Total Bookings are over 103K,
Total Revenue is about $1.54 million,
and the Average Trip Distance is 3 miles.

We also found that UberX is the most popular vehicle, making up nearly 40% of all rides. Most users prefer Uber Pay — around 67% — compared to cash or other methods.
Another cool insight: the longest ride was 144 miles, from the Lower East Side to Crown Heights North."

🟧 Section 3: Time Analysis (2:00–3:00)
"This page shows trip activity by time.
We learned that the most active hours are between 2 PM and 6 PM, especially on weekends.
Tuesdays and Sundays see the most rides, while Wednesdays are quieter.

This kind of analysis is valuable for Uber to schedule more drivers during peak hours and save costs during off-peak times."

🟩 Section 4: Trip Details (3:00–3:45)
"In the third section, I created a detailed table showing every trip — with filters for vehicle type, time, pickup and drop-off locations, and booking amount. This is helpful for drilling into specific trips, checking outliers, or doing audits."

💡 Section 5: Key Insights & Recommendations (3:45–4:30)
_"Some business insights from the dashboard include:

Afternoon and weekend demand is high → Uber should increase driver supply in these windows

UberX is clearly preferred → consider more investment or promotions around it

Digital payments dominate → cashless incentives could increase loyalty_

This dashboard isn’t just for analysis — it supports real business decisions. That’s why I also added a decision-making template to guide what actions Uber could take."

🎯 Section 6: Tools Used (4:30–4:50)
"The tools I used are Power BI for visuals and interactivity, DAX for KPIs like Trip Type, Farthest Trip, and Most Frequent Locations, and Excel for initial data preparation."

🔚 Outro (4:50–5:10)
"Thanks for watching! I hope this walkthrough gave you a clear idea of how to turn data into decisions using Power BI. If you'd like to see the dashboard or explore more projects, check the links below. Don’t forget to subscribe for more case studies!"

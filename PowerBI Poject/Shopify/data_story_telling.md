# 🎤 **Storytelling Script for Shopify Sales Project**

---

## 🧑‍💼 **1. Introduction (Set the context)**

> Hello! My name is Mohammad Ali, and I’d like to walk you through a data analytics project I completed using a Shopify sales dataset.
>
> This project demonstrates a complete data workflow — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Python to building a dynamic dashboard in Power BI. My goal was to derive business insights that could help stakeholders improve revenue, customer retention, and operational decision-making.

---

## 📊 **2. Data Understanding & Cleaning**

> The dataset consisted of over 7,400 rows of sales data — including information about orders, customers, locations, product types, pricing, tax, and payment methods.
>
> I began with exploratory data analysis in Python. I cleaned the data by handling missing values in `Product Id` and `Variant Id`, removed duplicates, and normalized fields like city names and dates.
>
> I also created new columns such as **Revenue per Unit**, **High-Tax Flags**, and **Purchase Date Features** like Month, Weekday, and Hour.

---

## 📈 **3. Visualizing the Business with Power BI**

> After preparing the data, I loaded it into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard with 5 core sections:

### 🧩 KPIs Panel

> I used cards to display key performance indicators like **Net Sales**, **Average Order Value**, **Total Customers**, **Repeat Rate**, and **Lifetime Value** — giving stakeholders an at-a-glance view of performance.

### 🌍 Regional Analysis

> Next, I added a filled map and bubble chart to visualize where customers were coming from. **Austin, Chicago, and San Francisco** emerged as the top-performing cities in both revenue and customer count.

### 🕒 Time-Based Trends

> I included line and bar charts showing daily and hourly sales trends. One interesting insight was that most purchases happened between **10 AM and 2 PM**, suggesting an ideal time window for promotions.

### 💳 Payment Gateway Breakdown

> I created a chart to show which payment gateways customers preferred. **Shopify Payments** dominated with over 85% of all transactions, followed by PayPal.

### 🛒 Product Performance

> Lastly, I analyzed performance by product type. **Climbing Shoes** had the highest sales volume and revenue, making it the best-selling product category.

---

## 🔍 **4. Key Findings & Insights**

> Through this analysis, I discovered several actionable insights:

* 21% of customers were repeat buyers, showing strong loyalty potential.
* Shopify Payments was the most trusted and widely used payment method.
* The midday hours were consistently the most active shopping time.
* A small number of cities and product types contributed to most of the revenue.

---

## 💡 **5. Recommendations**

> Based on the data, I made a few strategic suggestions:

* Launch a **customer loyalty program** to increase repeat purchases.
* Focus marketing efforts on **top-performing regions** like Austin and Chicago.
* Promote **best-selling products** like Climbing Shoes using bundles or discounts.
* Schedule campaigns during **peak buying hours (10 AM–2 PM)**.
* Offer **incentives** to promote underused payment gateways like PayPal.

## ✅ **6. Conclusion**

> This project showcases how data can be transformed into a decision-making tool. From raw CSVs to actionable insights — I applied data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and dashboarding.
>
> The final Power BI dashboard allows business teams to filter by city, product, or gateway and immediately see how performance changes.
>
> It’s a strong example of combining technical data skills with business understanding to deliver impact.

## 🎯 **7. Final Words (Close Confidently)**

> Thank you for reviewing my project!
> I'm excited to continue building solutions like this — combining Python, SQL, and dashboarding tools to support real business goals.
>
> I’d love to hear your feedback or ideas on how to take this even further.
